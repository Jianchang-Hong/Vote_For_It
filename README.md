# Vote For It

## Introduction

Vote For It(VFI) is a web application built with Flask for managing user profiles, votes, and more. This application supports user registration, login, profile management, voting, and administrative functions.

## Features

- User authentication (login, registration, logout)
- User profile management
- competition setup
- vote
- Admin and moderator roles
- Profile image upload and deletion
- Error handling pages for common HTTP errors (400, 404, 500)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- MySQL or compatible database

## Installation
1. Setup timezone
```shell
export TZ="Pacific/Auckland"

# Modify wsgi.py
import os
import time

os.environ["TZ"] = "Pacific/Auckland"
time.tzset()
```


1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/COMP639S2_project_2_Nu.git
    cd COMP639S2_project_2_Nu
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Configure the database connection. Create a `connect.py` file in the project root with your database settings:

    ```python
    DB_HOST = 'localhost'
    DB_USER = 'your_db_user'
    DB_PASSWORD = 'your_db_password'
    DB_NAME = 'your_db_name'
    SECRET_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
    ```

5. Initialize the database with the required tables. You can find the SQL scripts in the `sql/` directory. Run the scripts using your preferred method (e.g., MySQL Workbench, command line).
```shell
# Create tables
source /home/comp639nup2/COMP639S2_project_2_Nu/data/schema.sql;

# Populate data
source /home/comp639nup2/COMP639S2_project_2_Nu/data/population.sql;

# reset db
source /home/comp639nup2/COMP639S2_project_2_Nu/data/reset_db.sql;

```
## Running the Application

1. Ensure your MySQL database server is running and accessible.

2. Start the Flask application:

    ```sh
    FLASK_APP=run.py flask run
    ```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

### User Registration

- Navigate to the registration page (`http://localhost:5000/register`).
- Fill in the required fields and submit the form to create a new account.

### User Login

- Navigate to the login page (`http://localhost:5000/login`).
- Enter your username and password to log in.

### Profile Management

- After logging in, navigate to your profile page (`http://localhost:5000/profile/<your_user_id>`).
- Update your profile information and save changes.

### Admin Functions

- Admin users can access the admin home page (`http://localhost:5000/users`) to manage user accounts.

## Project Structure

- `app/`: Contains the Flask application modules and templates
- `static/`: Static files (e.g., CSS, JavaScript, images)
- `templates/`: HTML templates for rendering pages
- `yob/`: Application logic and utility functions
- `tests`: Test functions
- `config.py`: Configuration settings for the application
- `connect.py`: Database settings for the application
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## Testing

This project uses [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end (E2E) testing, providing a robust and reliable solution for testing. Cypress stands out from other testing frameworks with its ability to perform tests directly in the browser, offering real-time reloading, automatic waiting, and an interactive GUI, making it easier to debug and develop tests.

### Setup

1. **Install Node.js**  
   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, as Cypress requires it to run.

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Navigate to the `tests/e2e` directory and run the following command to install all required dependencies:
```bash
   npm install
```
### Running Tests
You can run Cypress tests in two different modes:

#### Interactive Mode
Open Cypress in interactive mode to visually see the tests running in the browser:
```bash
npm run open
```
#### Headless Mode
Run all tests in headless mode without opening the GUI, useful for CI/CD pipelines:
```bash
npm run test
```
This command will execute all the E2E tests in the terminal and generate a test report.

### Additional Information
- Test Files: All test cases are located in the `tests/e2e/cypress/e2e` directory. The test files are written in JavaScript.
- Configuration: Cypress configuration settings are managed in the `cypress.config.js` file.
- Test Reports: Test results, including screenshots and videos (in headless mode), are stored in the `tests/e2e/cypress/reports directory.
